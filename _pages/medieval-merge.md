I worked on Medieval Merge at [Pixodust Games](https://pixodust.com/) as a Lead Programmer. I led a team of 4 developers through the prototyping, soft launch, global launch and live service phases.

Medieval Merge is a Merge-2 puzzle game where you craft tools and weapons, restore buildings, and fight enemies.

The game was released in 2021.
