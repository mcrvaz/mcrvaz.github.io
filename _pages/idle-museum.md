I worked on Idle Museum at [Pixodust Games](https://pixodust.com/) as a Generalist Programmer, and went through the prototyping, soft launch, global launch and live service phases.

Idle Museum is an Idle/Simulation game where you build and expand a museum and search for world's most prized relics.

The game was released in 2020.
