I worked on Rocket Star at [Pixodust Games](https://pixodust.com/) as a Generalist Programmer, and went through the prototyping, soft launch, global launch and live service phases.
This was my first professional game project.

Rocket Star is an Idle/Simulation game where you build a rocket factory and explore the galary.

The game was released in 2019.
