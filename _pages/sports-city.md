I worked on Sports City at [Pixodust Games](https://pixodust.com/) as a Generalist Programmer, and went through the prototyping, soft launch, global launch and live service phases.

Sports City is an Idle/Simulation game where you build and evolve a city that hosts sport events.

The game was released in 2020.
